# digeart

Deep cuts from 150+ curated channels. All underground. All human-selected.

**[digeart.vercel.app](https://digeart.vercel.app)**

## Features

- Multi-genre & multi-tag filtering (Hot, Rare, New)
- YouTube-powered playback with persistent player
- 150+ curated underground channels
- Samples, mixes & DJ sets
- Dark/light themes
- Google auth + saved tracks
- Keyboard shortcuts

## How it works

1. Browse curated tracks across **For You**, **Samples**, and **Mixes** tabs
2. Filter by genre (House, Techno, Breaks...) and tags (Hot, Rare, New)
3. Click any card to play — controls, seek, and volume live in the player bar
4. Sign in with Google to save tracks and sync across devices
5. Press `?` for keyboard shortcuts

## Under the hood

- **Seeded daily shuffle** — track pool reshuffles every 24h so the feed feels fresh without losing consistency
- **3-tier channel pipeline** — channels go through import → curation (approve/reject) → Supabase storage
- **Tag engine** — Hot (50k+ views), Rare (<5k views), New (last 30 days) computed from YouTube metadata
- **YouTube player reuse** — single iframe, `loadVideoById()` for seamless track switching with no reload

## Roadmap

- [ ] Multi-curator support (invite other diggers to curate)
- [ ] Social follows (follow curators, personalized feeds)
- [ ] Discogs integration (label discovery, release metadata, rarity)
- [ ] Playlist export
